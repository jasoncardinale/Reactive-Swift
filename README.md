# Reactive-Swift

This is essentially going to be written as a tutorial but it is mainly just a series of exercises I am writing to
better understand how to use reactive programming in a an Xcode project accompanied by some notes.

## Observables
The main idea behind an observable is to essentially keep track of a sequence of events. These events (or objects or types)
can also receive updates asynchonously. 


## Creating Observables
